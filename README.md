# Method

A simple BitcoinCash ATM proof of concept


## The Problem

Existing cryptocurrency ATMs have a few issues that violate the philosphy that many cryptocurrency users hold. These are the problems Method hopes to address.

### Privacy

Cryptocurrency ATMs almost universally require extensive identification, including phone numbers, driver's licenses, and full names.

### Fees

When making transactions using an ATM, customers almost always have to pay high network and service fees.

### Centralization

The cryptocurrency ATMs you see in stores and other populated areas are all owned by just a few companies, instead of following the decentralized nature cryptocurrency was built on.


## Features

Method has several features that set it apart from the rest of the ATMs you'll encounter.

### Anonymous

Method requires absolutely zero forms of identification. Just enter your wallet address and form of payment.

### Low Fees

Method is built on BitcoinCash, ensuring customers don't have to pay unnecessary fees.

### Decentralized

Each Method instance is completely self hosted and free standing, and doesn't need to be connected to a larger ATM network to function.
